            What are other technologies/industries where a SpaceX style approach

              For decades spaceflight was so expensive that the market grew very
              slowly and there was low levels of technical innovation. Then
              SpaceX, a mission-driven organization, came along and proved that
              the problem was institutional rather than technological. They
              built a technically conservative, minimum viable product (Falcon 9
              v1.0/cargon dragon), rapidly iterated on it over the course of a
              decade (creating whole new uses for the tech that had never been
              done before, LEO satellite internet constellations), attracted a
              lot of excited talent, to achieve something transformational. What
              other fields do you think there are/could be like this? I've heard
              a lot of people in advanced nuclear startups (both breeder
              reactors & fusion) talk about how SpaceX was an inspiration to
              them, and how they feel like there's enormous room for
              improvement.For decades spaceflight was so expensive that the
